I'm Suhyun Kim, an AI researcher and an M.S./Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence at Yonsei University. I'm advised by Prof. [Sungjae Hwang](https://micv.yonsei.ac.kr/seongjae) at [MICV Lab](https://micv.yonsei.ac.kr/home). I started in physics and later added a double major in software, with time spent on computer systems and work at the intersection of physics and AI.

I'm interested in aligning model representations with neural data, and exploring what that alignment can reveal about learning from real-world data. Much of my work has involved imperfect datasets—often noisy and limited—so I'm used to designing methods that work under data constraints.

Ask why. When a question really grabs me, I'll dig in and keep at it—going deep, prototyping fast, and iterating until the evidence is clear. I bring that same mindset outside the lab, too. Climbing keeps me honest: I'm on the smaller side, so the default beta doesn't always fit, which means I'm always finding my own way up. That's somlglitch—small frame, big on clever workarounds, and not sold on one-size-fits-all answers.
